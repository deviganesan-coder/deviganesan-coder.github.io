                <h3>Automatic Financial Reconciliation</h3>
                <a>Associated with Accenture in India</a>

                <p align="left">
                    This project aimed to streamline the traditionally tedious and error-prone manual process of 
                    matching the ledger records with bank statements.                            
Developed a genetic algorithm-based module that significantly improved the efficiency of the reconciliation process.
<br><br>
<b>Technical Summary:</b> Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution, commonly used for
solving complex problems through processes like selection, crossover, and mutation. 
In this project, a novel GA approach was specifically designed for the automatic reconciliation matching problem. 
Unlike traditional GA methods that rely on binary or real-valued vector representations, the proposed algorithm uses an 
innovative arithmetic operation-based crossover directly on floating-point numbers. 
This novel approach eliminates the need for vector encodings and enhances time efficiency. 
Additionally, the proposed approach features a tailored selection strategy and mutation operation, resulting in improved accuracy, 
reduced memory consumption, and faster computation compared to conventional methods.
<br><br>

<b>Outcomes</b> The new module enhanced operational efficiency by reducing the time required for reconciliation, leading to
faster financial processing and fewer manual errors. Achieved approximately 60% reduction in running time compared to the previous Java-based module using combinatorial enumeration.
